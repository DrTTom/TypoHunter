TypoHunter
==========

This is a test to find typos in documents which are not texts in any natural language like program source codes.
The massive use of abbreviations makes it awkward to use a traditional spell checker for those files.

Working with black lists, this test can not assure correct spelling, but
- produces almost no false positives
- can work even in documents with mixed language
- has still found lots of typos in each project I ever ran it on
